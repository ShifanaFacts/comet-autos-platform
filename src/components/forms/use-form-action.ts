/**
 * useActionState for forms that must keep what the user typed when the
 * server rejects it. Passing an action straight to <form action> makes React
 * reset every uncontrolled field after submission — including on validation
 * errors — so this submits via onSubmit instead.
 *
 * It also makes submitting safe to repeat:
 *  - a second submit while the first is still running is ignored;
 *  - every submission carries a one-time `requestKey`, kept until the server
 *    accepts it, so the server can recognise a repeat (double click, retry
 *    after a slow response) and record it only once (lib/request-keys.ts).
 *    A new key is issued after each success, for the next entry.
