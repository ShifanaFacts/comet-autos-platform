/*
 * The parts on an invoice or a quotation, tied to the catalogue.
 *
 * An invoice sells parts out of stock, so every Parts line typed on one
 * names the catalogue part it is (partId) and what one of it cost (unitCost
 * — decided by whoever writes the invoice, the part's last purchase cost
 * when left blank). That is what takes it out of stock (lib/inventory/
 * invoice-stock.ts) and books its cost of sales (lib/accounting/postings.ts).
 * A line typed with no part is refused: it is the hole that let parts be
 * sold without ever being bought.
 *
 * Two kinds of Parts line stay free of it: a line billed from a job's repair
 * records (its part left stock when it was fitted), and a line already on an
 * invoice issued before parts were tied to stock, kept as it was.
 *
 * Quotations may name the part too (it is carried onto the invoice), but
 * need not: a part can be quoted before it is ever bought.
