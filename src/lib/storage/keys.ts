 * sitting loose at the top level:
 *
 *   comet-autos/bills/2026-09/…        supplier bills (expenses, purchases)
 *   comet-autos/invoices/2026-09/…     files kept with sales invoices
 *   comet-autos/receipts/2026-09/…     files kept with receipts and payments
 *   comet-autos/job-photos/2026-09/…   photos taken on a job
 *   comet-autos/signatures/2026-09/…   customer signatures
 *   comet-autos/accounts/2026-09/…     journals, fixed assets, payroll, VAT
 *   comet-autos/other/2026-09/…        anything else
 *
 * The name itself is random and never the user's file name. The folder is
 * for people browsing storage; the app finds a file by the key saved on its
 * Document row, so files stored under the older `org/…` keys keep working.
